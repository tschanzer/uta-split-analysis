# UTA split analysis

Results from Ultra-Trail Australia are posted on LiveTrail.net, where
they are displayed as a list of names and finish times. Clicking on
each finisher opens a page that shows their split times at the
numerous timing points out on the course.

But what if one wishes to visualise the distribution of split times across
the field? Clicking through thousands of individual results would be a
laborious task. Here, we present a web-scraping program that gathers
every runner's split times into a single CSV file, enabling easy further
analysis.

In addition to split time distributions for the whole UTA50 and UTA100
fields, we provide distributions for each of the seven start groups
and for runners in several finish time brackets.
